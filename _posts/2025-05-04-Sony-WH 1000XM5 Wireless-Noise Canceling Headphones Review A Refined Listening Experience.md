[Sony's WH-1000XM](https://amzn.to/4m2uNKR) series has long dominated the premium headphone space. From industry-leading noise cancellation to plush comfort and refined sound, each iteration raised the bar. Now, with the release of the Sony WH-1000XM5, the company takes a bold step by completely redesigning its flagship headphones ‚Äî both inside and out.

But does this new design, coupled with smarter tech and better performance, warrant the higher price tag? I spent several weeks with the XM5 to find out ‚Äî and here‚Äôs everything you need to know.

## Sleek New Design: Lightweight, But Less Compact

The first thing you‚Äôll notice about the WH-1000XM5 is its completely revamped design. Sony ditches the collapsible form factor of the XM4 in favor of a minimalist, seamless frame. The result is a lighter (250g), more streamlined headset that feels futuristic and premium.

The earcups are slimmer, and the synthetic leather padding is luxuriously soft, making these one of the most comfortable over-ear headphones on the market ‚Äî even during long sessions.

Downside? The XM5 no longer folds into a compact shape. This affects portability, especially for travelers, as it now comes with a larger, structured carrying case.

## Audio Quality: Clean, Balanced, and Natural

Sony replaced the XM4‚Äôs 40mm drivers with new 30mm carbon-fiber composite drivers, tuned for clarity and balance. And it pays off.

The sound profile is noticeably more refined:

- **Bass**: Still present, but more controlled and less boomy than previous models.
- **Mids**: Rich and full, particularly great for vocals, podcasts, and acoustic music.
- **Highs**: Smooth and crisp without harshness.

The soundstage feels wider, with excellent instrument separation. Whether you‚Äôre listening to classical, hip-hop, or ambient soundscapes, the XM5 delivers a clear and immersive experience.

For audiophiles, LDAC support and DSEE Extreme upscaling mean you can enjoy high-resolution audio (especially on Android devices).

## Noise Cancellation: The Best Just Got Better

Sony‚Äôs noise cancellation has been the industry benchmark ‚Äî and the WH-1000XM5 somehow makes it even better.

The XM5 uses eight microphones and two noise-canceling processors to adaptively block ambient noise. From the rumble of buses to office chatter and wind noise, the headphones create an eerily silent cocoon.

Whether you‚Äôre working in a caf√©, commuting on a train, or flying across time zones, the XM5 offers the most effective noise cancellation currently available.

Ambient Sound Mode also lets in external audio naturally when needed ‚Äî ideal for hearing announcements or conversations without removing the headset.

## Smart Features & Connectivity

Sony packs in plenty of smart features to make the user experience seamless:

- **Multi-point Bluetooth pairing**: Connect to two devices at once ‚Äî like your laptop and phone.
- **Speak-to-Chat**: Music pauses automatically when you start talking.
- **Wear detection**: Takes off automatically when you remove the headphones.
- **Voice assistants**: Built-in support for Google Assistant and Alexa.

The Headphones Connect app lets you customize EQ, adjust noise cancellation levels, and manage firmware updates easily.

One small annoyance: touch controls can sometimes misread gestures in very cold or humid conditions ‚Äî not a deal-breaker, but worth noting.

## Battery Life: Consistently Strong

Battery life on the WH-1000XM5 remains 30 hours with ANC on, and 40 hours without ANC ‚Äî identical to the XM4, which is impressive given the increased performance demands.

Better yet, fast charging gives you 3 hours of playback from just a 3-minute charge using USB-C. Full charge takes about 3.5 hours.

## Call Quality: Sharper Than Before

Sony claims massive improvements in call quality thanks to four beamforming mics and AI-based noise reduction. After testing several calls indoors and outdoors, I can confirm voices come through clearly, and background noise is largely suppressed.

In busy environments, some wind or traffic still bleeds through, but it‚Äôs a notable improvement over older models.

## Portability & Build Trade-Offs

This is one area where Sony made a trade-off. The new design, while elegant and lightweight, comes at the cost of portability. Unlike the XM4, the XM5 cannot fold inward, and instead requires a larger molded carrying case.

For frequent flyers or space-conscious users, this is a step back in convenience. The case does look premium, though, and protects the headphones well.

## Pricing & Value

The WH-1000XM5 launched at $399 USD (approx. $558 CAD), putting it in the high-end headphone tier alongside competitors like the Bose QuietComfort Ultra and Apple AirPods Max.

Is it worth it? If you prioritize sound quality, noise cancellation, and comfort, the XM5 is among the best. But if you already own the XM4, the upgrades may feel incremental ‚Äî especially if portability matters to you.

## Final Verdict: Should You Buy the WH-1000XM5?

**üëç Pros:**
- Best-in-class noise cancellation
- Balanced and detailed sound
- Exceptional comfort
- Strong battery life + fast charging
- Smart features like multi-point and speak-to-chat

**üëé Cons:**
- No longer foldable for travel
- Premium price tag
- Touch controls occasionally finicky

The Sony WH-1000XM5 is not a revolutionary leap, but a masterclass in refinement. It improves upon an already excellent foundation with better ANC, smarter features, and a more comfortable design.

If you‚Äôre in the market for premium wireless headphones that deliver in nearly every category ‚Äî and can live with the less portable form factor ‚Äî the WH-1000XM5 is one of the best options money can buy.

**Final Rating: 9.3/10**
